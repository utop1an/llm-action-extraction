After making all the sandwiches, they are placed onto tray number 1. Then, this tray is moved from one place to the kitchen (presumably for preparation or storage). Following that, the tray is brought back to table number 1 where two sandwiches – specifically the first one intended for child 1 and a different second sandwich meant for child 4 – are served directly from the tray onto that table. The tray is then moved again, this time to table number 2 where it's placed down (perhaps after being emptied or rearranged). Finally, at table number 3, the third and fourth sandwiches are taken off tray 1 and served there respectively, with the third sandwich going to child 2 and the fourth one intended for child 3.

These sandwiches were then placed onto tray one. After that, tray one was moved from the kitchen to table number one. At this point, sandw1 was served to child four at table number one. Following its serving, tray one was relocated again, this time from table number one to table number two. There, sandw2 was served to child one at table number two.
